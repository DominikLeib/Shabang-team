            <h2>Planteplaneter are small decorative “planets”, designed as an alternative to to ordinary houseplant.
            </h2>
            <p>
                By presenting the plants as little flying planets, they become magic hanging sculptures.
                We make the planteplaneter by hand in Denmark, and they are based on traditional Japanese techniques
                with a
                modern, Scandinavian twist. They can be hung from shelves, hooks from the ceiling and are perfect for
                unused spaces. Planteplaneter gives a poetic and decorative feeling to your home and are a different way
                to
                grow and display plants.
